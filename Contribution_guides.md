Welcome to the SmartOSEK community! We are dedicated to contributing to an embedded software platform for automotive electronic control, establishing a micro real-time secure embedded operating system that complies with automotive electronic control and OSEK standards. We welcome contributions from the community. There are many ways to contribute, such as correcting typos, improving documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code that can be integrated into SmartOSEK itself.

We welcome all kinds of contributions, including but not limited to:
Bug Fixes:
- Typo Errors: You can directly submit a Pull Request to correct typos in the code or documentation.
- Code Errors: If the modification involves significant changes, you can first create an issue describing the error and how to reproduce it. Other developers will discuss with you and propose suitable solutions. After fixing the error and adding corresponding unit tests, submit a Pull Request.

### New Features:
- If you want to contribute a new feature or enhance functionality for the operating system, and the modification involves significant changes, you should create an issue to discuss and propose a suitable design with our developers. After implementing the new feature or enhancement, submit a Pull Request and add corresponding unit tests.

### Documentation:
